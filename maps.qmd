# GIS Projects

Here are some of the maps and spatial analyses I've created, focusing on urban planning and public health applications in New York City.

## Featured Map 1: NYC Food Access Analysis

**Grocery Store & Deli Distribution**

**Description**:\
New York City, one of the most populous urban centers in the world, is home to a diverse and bustling population. With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. With this analysis, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals. 


**Tools**: R

**Key Features**: - Identified "food deserts" where the scope is solely grocery stores and 
delis. Their distribution is related to the poverty rate and median income per MODZCTA

## Featured Map 2: South Queens Commute Analysis

**Queens Link Impact Study**

**Description**:\
The MTA is a vital mode of transportation for many New Yorkers and a great alternative to cars, especially when there is traffic. However, a closer examination of the subway map shows that only certain areas in Queens and Brooklyn connect multiple subway lines. To address this, QueensLink is a plan to extend the M line along the A line to Far Rockaway. Making use of old LIRR train stations that go through Forest Park, the plan minimizes additional construction and substitutes the popular buses which many residents take to get to the major train stations. I hypothesized that the introduction of new M stations and their integration with existing A stations will lead to a reduction in residents’ commute times. 

**Tools**: R (sf), Google Maps API

**Key Features**: - Identified census tracts in south queens with highest commute times to work, before and after new stations

## Featured Map 3: Bronx Housing Conditions

**311 Call Spatial Analysis**

**Description**:\
Mapped and analyzed 311 complaint patterns related to housing maintenance issues across Bronx Community Districts.

**Tools**: ArcGIS Pro

**Key Features**: - Small multiple chloropleth maps - Highlights top housing complaints
in the Bronx

**Output**:\
