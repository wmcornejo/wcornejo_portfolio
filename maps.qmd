## NYC Web Map

**Mapping Asthma and COPD rates in New York City area**

The relationship between highway traffic and air quality is often overlooked. However, highway traffic can significantly impact air quality, leading to increased levels of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants can have serious health effects, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health impacts of highway traffic can be particularly pronounced in low-income and minority communities, which are often located near major highways and transportation corridors. These communities may be exposed to higher levels of air pollution, leading to increased rates of respiratory illnesses such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This web map allows for users to see the spatial relationships
between car density, pollutants, and environmental effects.

## NYC Food Access Analysis

**Grocery Store & Deli Distribution**

New York City, one of the most populous urban centers in the world, is home to a diverse and bustling population. With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. With this analysis, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals.
