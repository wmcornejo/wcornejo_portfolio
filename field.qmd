# I also like being outside :)

My field work experience has allowed me to combine my passion for the environment with practical skills in trail mapping, park management, and community engagement. Below are some highlights from my internships and volunteer events.

## GIS Trail Mapping Internship  
**The Natural Areas Conservancy**  
*June - August 2024*

### Overview
As a **GIS & Trail Mapping Intern** with the Natural Areas Conservancy, I was responsible for mapping and assessing trails in natural areas to improve accessibility and conservation efforts.
For the summer of 2024, I, along with my partner, were tasked with mapping the 
*North Forty Natural Area* in Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn New York.

This role involved extensive fieldwork, data collection, and collaboration with conservation teams.

### Key Responsibilities
- Conducted **ground-truthing** to map trail conditions, including surface type, width, and accessibility features.
- Used **GPS devices** and ESRI software (ArcGIS Online, FieldMaps) to create detailed trail maps.
- Collected and analyzed data on **vegetation**, **erosion**, and **wildlife habitats** along trails.
- Contributed trail data to the official NYC Parks Trail Map on ArcGIS Online.

### Volunteer Events
During my internship, I also participated in and led **volunteer events**, including:


- **Trail Cleanups**: Organized and led groups of volunteers to remove litter and debris from trails.
- **Invasive Species Removal**: Worked with volunteers to remove invasive plants and restore native habitats.

We also participated in volunteer events in other parks across NYC, like Prospect
Park and in Staten Island.

We also spent a week in Eleuthera, Bahamas where we collected tree data in 
the Leon Levy Natural Preserve.
