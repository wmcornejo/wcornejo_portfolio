Here are some of my programming-based projects. I mainly branched out to data-
analysis related programs for my own research. Most of my work is in Python, 
Jupyter Notebook, C++, and R.

## Car Collision Analysis in King County, Washington

Throughout the United States, a significant portion of the population relies on cars for transportation. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of a car collision. Its primary aim is to offer the safest possible route to a destination. Ultimately, this initiative aims to enhance road safety, benefiting all drivers, whether they are commuting for work or leisure, and ensuring that they can navigate with increased safety compared to current conditions.


**Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn

**Key Features**:

- Performed exploratory data analysis to clean and interpret data.
- Applied Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models.
- Severity of a collision is higher when the collision occurs at an intersection.
