## My Journey into GIS

Up until 3 years ago, GIS was foreign to me. I had no idea what it stood for and had no interest in it as a career, or even the knowledge of it. What began as curiosity during an undergraduate geography class has evolved into a career at the intersection of technology and environmental problem-solving. I discovered that GIS isn't just about making maps—it’s a unique lens for understanding spatial relationships and revealing patterns that drive real-world solutions.

This realization redirected my path from traditional computer science toward geospatial innovation, leading me through:

- **Urban Conservation**: Mapping NYC's ecosystems with Parks & Recreation and the Natural Areas Conservancy  
- **Advanced Learning**: Developing cutting-edge skills through Hunter College's Master's program in GIS  
- **Clean Energy Impact**: Contributing to national renewable energy optimization at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory

Today, I approach every project with the understanding that **spatial thinking reveals solutions**—whether optimizing solar installations, protecting urban green spaces, or improving public health outcomes.

## What Drives Me

I'm passionate about using technology to solve problems related to climate change, public health and urban sustainability. My unique combination of computer science fundamentals and geospatial expertise allows me to build solutions that are both technically robust and practically meaningful.

**Current Interests:**

- Climate resilience and renewable energy optimization
- Environmental justice and equitable access to resources  
- Smart city technologies and sustainable urban planning
- Open-source geospatial tools and community-driven solutions

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not analyzing spatial data or building mapping applications, you'll find me exploring NYC's trail systems, volunteering with at Forest Park, biking, or taking pictures.

I believe the best geospatial solutions come from understanding both the technology and the places we're trying to improve—which is why I spend as much time in the field as I do behind a computer.
