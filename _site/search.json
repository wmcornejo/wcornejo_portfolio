    "section": "Beyond the Code",
    "text": "Beyond the Code\nWhen I‚Äôm not analyzing spatial data or building mapping applications, you‚Äôll find me exploring NYC‚Äôs trail systems (often documenting them for conservation efforts), volunteering with environmental organizations, or experimenting with new visualization techniques.\nI believe the best geospatial solutions come from understanding both the technology and the places we‚Äôre trying to improve‚Äîwhich is why I spend as much time in the field as I do behind a computer."
