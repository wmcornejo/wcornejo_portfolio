Below are some highlights from my internships and volunteer events.\n\n\n\nThe Natural Areas Conservancy\nJune - August 2024\n\n\nAs a GIS & Trail Mapping Intern with the Natural Areas Conservancy, I was responsible for mapping and assessing trails in natural areas to improve accessibility and conservation efforts. For the summer of 2024, I, along with my partner, were tasked with mapping the North Forty Natural Area in Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn New York.\nThis role involved extensive fieldwork, data collection, and collaboration with conservation teams.\n\n\n\n\nConducted ground-truthing to map trail conditions, including surface type, width, and accessibility features.\nUsed GPS devices and ESRI software (ArcGIS Online, FieldMaps) to create detailed trail maps.\nCollected and analyzed data on vegetation, erosion, and wildlife habitats along trails.\nContributed trail data to the official NYC Parks Trail Map on ArcGIS Online.\n\n\n\n\nDuring my internship, I also participated in and led volunteer events, including:\n\nTrail Cleanups: Organized and led groups of volunteers to remove litter and debris from trails.\nInvasive Species Removal: Worked with volunteers to remove invasive plants and restore native habitats.\n\nWe also participated in volunteer events in other parks across NYC, like Prospect Park and in Staten Island.\nWe also spent a week in Eleuthera, Bahamas where we collected tree data in the Leon Levy Natural Preserve.\n\n\n\n\nCaption: Conducting a trail survey in [Park Name].\n\nCaption: Leading a trail cleanup event with volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\n[NYC Parks & Recreation]\nJuly 2023 - June 2024\n\n\nAs a Park Management Intern, I played a key role in planning and executing park repairs, leading volunteer events, and ensuring the maintenance of public spaces. This internship allowed me to develop leadership and project management skills while contributing to the community.\n\n\n\n\nPlanned and supervised park repair projects, including trail maintenance, signage installation, and infrastructure improvements.\nLed volunteer events, recruiting and managing teams of volunteers for park cleanups and restoration projects.\nConducted site assessments to identify areas in need of repair or improvement.\nCollaborated with local organizations and community members to promote park stewardship.\n\n\n\n\nDuring this internship, I organized and led several volunteer events, including:\n\nPark Cleanups: Coordinated teams to remove litter and maintain park facilities.\nTree Planting: Led volunteers in planting native trees to restore park ecosystems.\nEducational Workshops: Hosted workshops to teach volunteers about park conservation and sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaption: Supervising a park repair project in [Park Name].\n\nCaption: Leading a tree planting event with volunteers."
