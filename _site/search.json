With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. With this analysis, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals.\nTools: R\nKey Features: - Identified “food deserts” where the scope is solely grocery stores and delis.

However, a closer examination of the subway map shows that only certain areas in Queens and Brooklyn connect multiple subway lines. To address this, QueensLink is a plan to extend the M line along the A line to Far Rockaway. Making use of old LIRR train stations that go through Forest Park, the plan minimizes additional construction and substitutes the popular buses which many residents take to get to the major train stations. I hypothesized that the introduction of new M stations and their integration with existing A stations will lead to a reduction in residents’ commute times.\nTools: R (sf), Google Maps API\nKey Features: - Identified census tracts in south queens with highest commute times to work, before and after new stations\n\nPotential time savings for residents of Ozone Park and Howard Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 Call Spatial Analysis\nDescription:\nMapped and analyzed 311 complaint patterns related to housing maintenance issues across Bronx Community Districts.\nTools: ArcGIS Pro\nKey Features: - Small multiple chloropleth maps - Highlights top housing complaints in the Bronx\nOutput:\n{.rounded .width=“500px” .height=“500px” .shadow width=“600px”}"
