With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. With this analysis, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals.\nTools: R\nKey Features: - Identified “food deserts” where the scope is solely grocery stores and delis.

Developed using Agile methodology, it features well-defined user stories and sprint planning. The API is containerized and designed as a microservice with enterprise-level security, including Flask-Talisman headers and Flask-CORS policies. It incorporates modern DevOps practices, such as automated GitHub Actions for continuous integration, Docker for scalability, and Kubernetes for production deployment. With automated tests achieving over 95% coverage and Tekton pipeline integration, this microservice demonstrates end-to-end software engineering, from planning to deployment.\nTechnologies: Docker, Kubernentes, Tekton, Github Actions, Zenhub, Python, Flask\nKey Features:\n\nDeveloped Agile plan to create RESTful microservice supporting 4 CRUD operations for user.\nManaged development using Github and Zenhub, completing 25+ user stories in 3 sprints.\nCreated Docker image and deployed microservice to Kubernetes cluster serving 900+ users.\nAutomated work pipeline using Tekton, reducing time from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.\nGitHub Repository"
