The health impacts of highway traffic can be particularly pronounced in low-income and minority communities, which are often located near major highways and transportation corridors.

With so many people constantly on the move—commuting to work, school, —the availability of food sources is essential. With this analysis, I aim to identify food deserts by examining the interplay between poverty rates, median income, and the availability of grocery stores. This project will assess the quality of food resources based on the presence and density of delis and grocery stores. While fast food restaurants are a popular choice for many, delis provide a more affordable and often quicker alternative, offering freshly made meals at lower prices than major fast-food chains. Grocery stores serve as the backbone of food access, supplying residents with everything they need for their weekly meals.\n\n\n\n\nTools: R, sf\nKey Features:\n\nIdentified “food deserts” where the scope is solely grocery stores and delis. Their distribution is related to the poverty rate and median income per MODZCTA"
