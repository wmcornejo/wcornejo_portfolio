    "text": "My Journey into GIS\nUp until 3 years ago, GIS was foreign to me. I had no idea what it stood for and had no interest in it as a career, or even the knowledge of it. What began as curiosity during an undergraduate geography class has evolved into a career at the intersection of technology and environmental problem-solving. I discovered that GIS isn’t just about making maps—it’s a unique lens for understanding spatial relationships and revealing patterns that drive real-world solutions.\nThis realization redirected my path from traditional computer science toward geospatial innovation, leading me through:\n\nUrban Conservation: Mapping New York City’s ecosystems with Parks & Recreation and the Natural Areas Conservancy\n\nAdvanced Learning: Developing cutting-edge skills through Hunter College’s Master’s program in GIS\n\nClean Energy Impact: Contributing to national renewable energy optimization at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\n\nToday, I approach every project with the understanding that spatial thinking reveals solutions—whether optimizing solar installations, protecting urban green spaces, or improving public health outcomes.\nFor a stable version of resume, please click here - William’s Resume"
