    "text": "Car Collision Analysis in King County, Washington\nThroughout the United States, a significant portion of the population relies on cars for transportation. The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of assessing the likelihood of a car collision. Its primary aim is to offer the safest possible route to a destination. Ultimately, this initiative aims to enhance road safety, benefiting all drivers, whether they are commuting for work or leisure, and ensuring that they can navigate with increased safety compared to current conditions.\nTechnologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, sklearn\nKey Features:\n\nPerformed exploratory data analysis to clean and interpret data.\nApplied Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models.\nSeverity of a collision is higher when the collision occurs at an intersection.\nGitHub Repository"
